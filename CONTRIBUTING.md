## Issues

- Please include a minimal reproducible example when filing an issue (bug report).
- It's probably a good idea to file your idea in issues before starting on a pull request.

## Pull requests
 
Pull requests should be made to the dev branch.

1. Create a branch on your fork.
2. Make changes. Limit your pull request in scope to addressing one issue or feature request.
3. Merge dev back into your branch to try to head off conflicts.
4. Push the branch to your fork.
5. Open a pull request.
6. We can discuss if neccessary. Changes pushed to your fork will update the pull request automatically.

## Style

- Use base R. I know I'm a dinosauR, but also I'd like to cut down on dependencies.

## Help

- [Sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/#platform-linux)
